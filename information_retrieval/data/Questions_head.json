Ripley (about the difference between machine learning\n  and statistics) useR! 2004, Vienna\n  (May 2004) :-) Season's Greetings!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Andrew Gelman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In that case, maybe we should get rid\n  of checking of models and assumptions\n  more often. Then maybe we'd be able to\n  solve some of the problems that the\n  machine learning people can solve but\n  we can't!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was also the <a href=\"http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726\"><strong>\"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures\"</strong> paper</a> by Leo Breiman in 2001 which argued that statisticians rely too heavily on data modeling, and that machine learning techniques are making progress by instead relying on the <em>predictive accuracy</em> of models.</p>\n\n<p>Has the statistics field changed over the last decade in response to these critiques?  Do the <em>two cultures</em> still exist or has statistics grown to embrace machine learning techniques such as neural networks and support vector machines?</p>\n"},"21":{"OwnerUserId":59,"CreationDate":"2010-07-19T19:24:36Z","Score":8,"Title":"Forecasting demographic census","Body":"<p>What are some of the ways to forecast demographic census with some validation and calibration techniques?</p>\n\n<p>Some of the concerns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Census blocks vary in sizes as rural\nareas are a lot larger than condensed\nurban areas.
