    "Title":"The Two Cultures: statistics vs. machine learning?",
    "Body":"<p>Last year, I read a blog post from <a href=\"http:\/\/anyall.org\/\">Brendan O'Connor<\/a> entitled <a href=\"http:\/\/anyall.org\/blog\/2008\/12\/statistics-vs-machine-learning-fight\/\">\"Statistics vs. Machine Learning, fight!\"<\/a> that discussed some of the differences between the two fields.  <a href=\"http:\/\/andrewgelman.com\/2008\/12\/machine_learnin\/\">Andrew Gelman responded favorably to this<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n<p>Simon Blomberg: <\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From R's fortunes\n  package: To paraphrase provocatively,\n  'machine learning is statistics minus\n  any checking of models and\n  assumptions'.\n  -- Brian D. Ripley (about the difference between machine learning\n  and statistics) useR! 2004, Vienna\n  (May 2004) :-) Season's Greetings!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Andrew Gelman:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In that case, maybe we should get rid\n  of checking of models and assumptions\n  more often. Then maybe we'd be able to\n  solve some of the problems that the\n  machine learning people can solve but\n  we can't!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>There was also the <a href=\"http:\/\/projecteuclid.org\/euclid.ss\/1009213726\"><strong>\"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures\"<\/strong> paper<\/a> by Leo Breiman in 2001 which argued that statisticians rely too heavily on data modeling, and that machine learning techniques are making progress by instead relying on the <em>predictive accuracy<\/em> of models.<\/p>\n\n<p>Has the statistics field changed over the last decade in response to these critiques?  Do the <em>two cultures<\/em> still exist or has statistics grown to embrace machine learning techniques such as neural networks and support vector machines?<\/p>\n"
